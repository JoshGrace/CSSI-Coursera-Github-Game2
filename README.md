# CSSI-Coursera-Github-Game2
This Github repository holds a Capture the Flag game created for the CSSI-Coursera program It has two components, I’ve linked to some tutorials to help everyone get familiar with git basics and committing/ pushing. Then I’ve made a Github repo that will have each week’s CTF challenges. Here are a few tutorial links how to use git in a corporate environment git:https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows https://guides.github.com/features/issues/ https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/ Here is the Github tutorial hosted on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iO7EY5_xVAM There are 7 flags hidden throughout the week 2 folder of varying difficulties, which are designed to demonstrate the various basic functionalities of git. When you find a flag, please DM me on slack (@JoshGrace(TA)) so I can confirm it for you.
